# ICS-141-Grade-Estimator

First commit only calculates up to week 11. Will update as needed.


How to use:
If you don't know git, you can always copy and paste the file into your own eclipse project and just hit run.
You'll have to download the "maxRegularPoints.txt" file in order for it to run also.

You can also run it through a command line if you have a Unix based system if you want.
